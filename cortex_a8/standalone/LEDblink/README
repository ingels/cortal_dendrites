LEDblink.
===========================================================================
This is a minimal standalone program to blink the LED's on the BeagleBoard.

This program is loaded above UBoot in RAM at address 0x82000000.

Linker script and startup code are absolutly minimal, only SVC stack is setup.

===========================================================================
Telnet OpenOCD session

load_image LEDblink
resume 0x8200000

============================================================================
GDB

From a cold start:

Run openocd in one terminal window.

Run arm-nene-eabi-gdb i another terminal window

The supplied .gdbinit initializes opmap3 debugging, loads the program into RAM
and starts it.

Use gdb commands as usual.

==============================================================================

Things to fix:

One major problem (090904) is that OpenOCD does not control invalidation 
of the I-cache when uploading updated program code to RAM. So the processor does not
execute the same code fron I-Cache as the debugger can read from memory thrugh the ADPMEMAP.
